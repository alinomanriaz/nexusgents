      "Google Ads place your business in front of customers at the exact moment they're searching for your solutions. Unlike organic methods, PPC delivers targeted traffic immediately, with complete control over budget and messaging. Our data-driven approach combines strategic keyword selection, negative keyword filtering, and AI-powered bidding to ensure you only pay for high-quality clicks. We continuously optimize campaigns based on conversion data to maximize your advertising ROI.",

      "Inefficient campaigns waste up to 76% of budgets on irrelevant clicks. Common pitfalls include broad match keywords without negatives, poor landing page alignment, and inadequate conversion tracking. Our audit process identifies these leaks, then implements Quality Score improvements, ad schedule optimization, and device bid adjustments. The result? Lower costs per conversion and sustainable scaling of your most profitable campaigns.",
